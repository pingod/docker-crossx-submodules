# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Docker Image CI (master)[openvpn-fss]


# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  # pull_request:
  #   branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    # - name: Fix up git URLs
    #   run: echo -e '[url "https://github.com/"]\n  insteadOf = "git@github.com:"' >> ~/.gitconfig
    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
